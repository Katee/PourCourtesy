# Pour Courtesy

A mind controlled conpetition for the courtesy of pouring a friend a drink.

The physical body for this project was built by Marc Reeve-Newson and includes a button on top (for changing modes) and two of [Seth Hardy's](https://github.com/asymptotic) 8x8 LED panels for the game countdown.
